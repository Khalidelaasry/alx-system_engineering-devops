# Project Title

0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters

## Description

In this project, I've learned and practiced several key command-line tools, including "head," "tail," "find," "wc," "sort," "uniq," "grep," and "tr," for efficient text and file manipulation in the Shell. I've gained expertise in redirecting input and output, understanding special characters, and using these commands for data extraction and processing. These skills are essential for data analysis, system administration, and automation in Unix-like environments.
