## Description

This is an introductory project on configuration files, distinguishing between local and global variables, exploring shell expansion, and mastering shell arithmetic.

## Project Files

5. **5-local_variables** - Lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions.
6. **6-create_local_variable** - Creates a new local variable named BEST with the value School.
7. **7-create_global_variable** - Creates a new global variable named BEST with the value School.
8. **8-true_knowledge** - Prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable TRUEKNOWLEDGE, followed by a new line.
9. **9-divide_and_rule** - Prints the result of POWER divided by DIVIDE, followed by a new line, where both are environment variables.
10. **10-love_exponent_breath** - Displays the result of BREATH to the power LOVE, followed by a new line, where both are environment variables.
11. **11-binary_to_decimal** - Converts a number stored in the environment variable BINARY from base 2 to base 10 and displays it followed by a new line.
12. **12-combinations** - Prints all possible combinations of two letters, except "oo" with the specifications:
    - Letters are lowercase, from a to z
    - One combination per line
    - The output should be alpha-ordered, starting with "aa"
    - Do not print "oo"
    - Script file should contain a maximum of 64 characters.
13. **13-print_float** - Prints a number stored in the environment variable NUM with two decimal places.
14. **100-decimal_to_hexadecimal** - Converts a number stored in the environment variable DECIMAL from base 10 to base 16 and displays it followed by a new line.
15. **101-rot13** - Encodes and decodes text using the rot13 encryption.
16. **102-odd** - Prints every other line from the input, starting with the first line.
17. **103-water_and_stir** - Adds the two numbers stored in the environment variables WATER and STIR and prints the result where:
    - WATER is in base water
    - STIR is in base stir
    - The result should be in base behlnort but in a different way.
